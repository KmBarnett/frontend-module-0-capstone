He spent the majority of his youth here in the orphanage growing up with other kids bigger than him picking on him and the other smaller children. One day when he was returning from school and he saw some of the kids that bullied him up ahead and decided to take a detour, that led him to the Scarlet Dojo. So he began his tutelage under his Sensei Ms. Scarlet learning the martial art of Kung Fu to protect himself and the other small kids at the “Phoenix Home”. He met his best friend Darius at the dojo and the two became rivals almost instantly as the showed talent in the material arts. In the dojo they were enemies, but outside of the dojo they were inseparable hanging out every day and bringing order to the “Phoenix Home” and recruiting almost all of the inhabitants to the Dojo bringing them together like a family. When Alexander reached the age of 18 his Sensei decided that she would hold a tournament to decide who would be her successor. In the final round he lost to Darius, Ms. Scarlet disqualified him for using lethal moves that were banned from her Dojo. Darius stormed off in anger as Alexander was announced as the next leader of the Dojo. He would officially receive his new title the on the night of the scarlet moon that was set to appear later in the month. On the night of the scarlet moon he returned to the dojo and what he found was the ghastly sight of his Sensei and all of his sibling students dead in pools of their own blood. He found his master clinging to life when she told him that it was Darius who murdered all of his family he vowed for Justice. He know travels the word as a mercenary for hire sending almost all of his earnings back to the “Phoenix Home” and searching for his adoptive brother who took everything from him planing to bring him to Justice.</p>
